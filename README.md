## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

In this project I used JavaScript XML to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement()
or appendChild() methods. I also used react hooks to isolate reusable parts from functional components.
